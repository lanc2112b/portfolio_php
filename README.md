## PHP Backend for Portfolio Site

A PHP backend API server for my portfilio project, to provide the endpoints and interface with the MySQL DB to store and retreive all of the content.

Just beyond MVP, so still some work to do and additions to be made.

Built using: 

PHP 8.1+  
MySQL (Was originally intended for MariaDB and used 'RETURNING', changed very last minute due to availability :( ).  

Libraries via Composer  
Guzzle  
phpdotenv  
Google API client  
PHPUnit 10.x   


Mirrored to GitHub from my Gitea (self hosted) instance.
